# RMI Application 

### Overview
This RMI (Remote Method Invocation) application demonstrates a simple client-server architecture for remote communication in Java. The application consists of a server that provides a remote service and a client that consumes this service over the network.

### Features
Remote Service: The server exposes a remote interface with methods that the client can invoke remotely.
Client Invocation: The client connects to the server and invokes methods on the remote interface.
Simple Processing: The server performs a simple processing task, such as string conversion, and returns the result to the client.
